        <p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, 
            that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
            that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to 
            secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their 
            just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of 
            Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People 
            to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its 
            foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to 
            them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, 
            indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed 
            for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, 
            that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than 
            to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. 
            But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same 
            Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their 
            right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new 
            Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance 
            of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them 
            to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present 
            King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all 
            having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these 
            States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
