HELLO!

I implemented both of my interactive features on my website's homepage. 

The first feature is to change the font size. Upon loading the homepage, a 
prompt should appear asking you what your preferred font size is. The number you enter and hit "OK"
on will become the font size for the homepage, in px. 

The second feature is to change the background image and color for the main text on the home page
(located in the Wave part of the background image). When you hover your mouse over the text, the background will become a 
darker blue color, and the text will become white. When you hover away, it returns 
to the default settings that could be seene upon loading the homepage. 

Enjoy.
